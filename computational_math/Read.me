Implementation of numerical methods in Python using computer vision. Recognition of mathematical problems of linear and higher algebra, mathematical analysis, differential equations, numerical optimization problems. Numerical methods for solving integral equations (difference method, Galerkin method, method of successive approximations) have not yet been implemented. Recognition using computer vision is not fully implemented.
